                        population with a Snap of his fingers. Stark furiously
                        confronts Rogers on the notion that the Avengers
                        remained fractured during their conflict with the Mad

                        together before passing out due to exhaustion. With a
                        tip from Nebula about her father's location, along with
                        a Snap-like energy signature from two days prior, the

                        using their own powers, which nearly killed him.
                        Although suspected of lying by Rhodes, Nebula vouches
                        for her father, as he is never a liar. Surprised with
                        the affirmation, Thanos reconsiders his torturous
                        treatment on his daughter, but he is then immediately
                        beheaded by Thor. Although the Mad Titan is dead, they
                        failed to accomplish their mission of resurrecting his
                        victims. Thus, they could do no more but walk away in

                        carried out in order for one to retrieve the stone.
                        Barton laughs at the concept, but Romanoff deduces that
                        it is indeed the truth, as Thanos had murdered his
                        daughter Gamora there in their time. Understanding the

                        insists he should do it due to the carnage he left
                        behind in the wake of his grief as Romanoff declares
                        that her life's work has led her to this moment. As they
                        dash to the cliff, they wrestle to keep each other away

                        Nebula to retrieve the Stones, her future self reveals
                        to Gamora their improved relationship in the future.
                        Gamora decides to join Nebula to stop her father.
                        Meanwhile, Rhodes, Rocket and Banner are trapped in a
                        flooding area, forcing Lang to come and save them.
                        Barton lands next to the gauntlet in the sewers, which
                        is infested with Outriders. After escaping them, he
                        unknowingly passes the apparatus to Past Nebula, who is
                        then confronted by Gamora and Nebula; the latter kills
                        her past self once she threatens her sister. Stark,
                        Rogers and Thor confront Thanos on the ground, who
                        intends to rebuild the entire universe using the Stones.
                        After Stark and Thor are overpowered and knocked aside
                        in the ensuing fight, Rogers wields Mj√∏lnir against the
                        time-displaced Titan. However, Thanos severely injures
                        him and nearly destroys his shield with his sword.

                        redirects its fire to an object arriving from outer
                        space. It was Carol Danvers, who comes to
                        single-handedly destroy the warship. Retrieving the
                        gauntlet from Parker, she enlists the aid of her fellow
                        female combatants as she dashes to the now-activated
                        van. However, Thanos uses his sword to destroy the
                        vehicle and the quantum portal. With the gauntlet in
                        Thanos' reach, Stark, Rogers, Thor and Danvers make
                        their last stand to keep it out of his hands. However,
                        he manages to shake all of his opposition aside and
                        equip the gauntlet. Strange informs Stark that this is
                        the one future that ends in their victory. Determined,
                        Stark dashes at Thanos one last time, but he is knocked
                        aside as the Titan snaps his fingers. Nothing happens,
                        as the Stones have been stolen by Stark and transferred
                        onto his suit. With the very being that has haunted him
                        for the past eleven years now at his mercy, Stark snaps
                        his own fingers.

                        mortally wounded from his usage of the Stones, and is
                        greeted by Rhodes, Parker and Potts as he lays dying.
                        Potts assures her husband that they are going to be
                        alright, and allows him to rest. Stark's Arc Reactor
                        then permanently shuts off, Potts giving him one last
                        kiss. Rogers and Thor mournfully watch at a distance.

                        when prompted, Barnes alerts Sam Wilson to the presence
                        of an elderly man nearby. It is an aged up Rogers, who
