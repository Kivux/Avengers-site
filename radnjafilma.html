                        population with a Snap of his fingers. Stark furiously
                        confronts Rogers on the notion that the Avengers
                        remained fractured during their conflict with the Mad

                        together before passing out due to exhaustion. With a
                        tip from Nebula about her father's location, along with
                        a Snap-like energy signature from two days prior, the

                        using their own powers, which nearly killed him.
                        Although suspected of lying by Rhodes, Nebula vouches
                        for her father, as he is never a liar. Surprised with
                        the affirmation, Thanos reconsiders his torturous
                        treatment on his daughter, but he is then immediately
                        beheaded by Thor. Although the Mad Titan is dead, they
                        failed to accomplish their mission of resurrecting his
                        victims. Thus, they could do no more but walk away in

                        female combatants as she dashes to the now-activated
                        van. However, Thanos uses his sword to destroy the
                        vehicle and the quantum portal. With the gauntlet in
                        Thanos' reach, Stark, Rogers, Thor and Danvers make
                        their last stand to keep it out of his hands. However,
                        he manages to shake all of his opposition aside and
                        equip the gauntlet. Strange informs Stark that this is
                        the one future that ends in their victory. Determined,
                        Stark dashes at Thanos one last time, but he is knocked
                        aside as the Titan snaps his fingers. Nothing happens,
                        as the Stones have been stolen by Stark and transferred
                        onto his suit. With the very being that has haunted him
                        for the past eleven years now at his mercy, Stark snaps
                        his own fingers.

                        mortally wounded from his usage of the Stones, and is
                        greeted by Rhodes, Parker and Potts as he lays dying.
                        Potts assures her husband that they are going to be
                        alright, and allows him to rest. Stark's Arc Reactor

                        defeat and the return of the Vanished calls for
                        celebrations all around the world, including in Wakanda

                        original Arc Reactor is set adrift in the lake outside
                        their cabin, with the Avengers and their allies in
                        attendance, including those who had past grievances with
                        Stark, such as the Pym family, Wanda, and Bucky Barnes.

                        goodbye to Barnes. As Banner is unable to bring him back
                        when prompted, Barnes alerts Sam Wilson to the presence
                        of an elderly man nearby. It is an aged up Rogers, who
                        had chosen to remain in the past and live out a full
                        life with Peggy Carter. He presents Wilson with a new
